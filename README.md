&nbsp;	Over-the-air Rocket Control \& Activation (Experimental)



v.1 8/24/25

There's not much to see here yet, as we are still working on building the repo as well as the project.



OCRA\_X is just a humble project to make model rocket launching more fun, more efficient and more better.



Consisting of two objects: a remote control, and a base station. Each having Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W's talking to each other using a server/client Wi-Fi connection. 



The base station uses a 20V DeWalt battery for hot-swap-ability to power the station itself and to provide current to fire the model rocket motor igniter. The base station also has features and indicators to make sure the user is aware of its current status of the operation.



The remote uses a rechargeable lithium polymer battery to power itself. The remote also has features and indicators to make sure the user is aware of the current status of the base station and also the remote.
